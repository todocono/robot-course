<ul>
<li>1 - how many people did he test?</li>
<li>2 - where did he tested it?</li>
<li>3 - where were the best engineers?</li>
<li>4 - who had the worst performance?</li>
<li>5 - how do kindergarten kids perform?</li>
<li>6 - why? where does that leave us a team?</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a complementary <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/tom_wujec_build_a_tower/transcript?language=en#t-29229"> video  with graphs of why is this happening.</a> </p>

<p>Detailed instructions are hosted here: <a href="http://marshmallowchallenge.com/Instructions.html"> marshmallowchallenge.com/instructions</a>. You will need them if you are an instructor and this is the first time you run it. </p>

<p><img src="images/1a.png" ALIGN="left"  alt="Automaton">
The word robot comes from a theatre play that showed some humanoid machines. According to (LieZi) in the 10th century B.C. Yan Shi made an humanoid that could move like we
do.
According to the roman legends, the God Vulcan created mechanical machines that could talk. The greek has stories about Talos, that was
built with bronze to protect their city. It is one of the best well known tradition that the jewish has a mythological automaton called “Golem”.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">There is something
that inspire humans and keeps us dreaming about animated creatures
that will do our work and help us to explore other worlds. We have
all been exposed to different movies and “crazy”  ideas about
what robots are going to do.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span lang="en-US">But
the future is here and now. Somewhere in the year 1770 there are
several documents about the first robot that could play
chess. It resembles a huge calculator with a manequen on top, but  it
is not so important how clumsy was it or how other fantasy stories
have been told about automaton. The key point to remember is that in
1996 the Chess World Champion Kasparov barely won to the computer
artificial intelligence Deep Blue. The designers at IBM updated the
self-learning machine and in 1997 the world saw the first time a
machine that could do something better than the best of us.</span></p>
