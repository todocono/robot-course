Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n- 1 how many people did he test?\r\n- 2 where did he tested it?\r\n- 3 where were the best engineers?\r\n- 4 who had the worst performance?\r\n- 5 how do kindergarten kids perform?\r\n- 6 why? where does that leave us a team?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n* 2.
